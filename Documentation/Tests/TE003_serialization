# Test Report on the Module com_lib.serialization

## Conventions

Each test is defined following the same format. Each test receives a unique test identifier and a reference to the ID(s) of the requirements it covers (if applicable). The goal of the test is described to clarify what is to be tested. The test steps are described in brief but clear instructions. For each test it is defined what the expected results are for the test to pass. Finally, the test result is given, this can be only pass or fail.

The test format is as follows:

**Test Identifier:** TEST-\[I/A/D/T\]-XYZ

**Requirement ID(s)**: REQ-uvw-xyz

**Verification method:** I/A/D/T

**Test goal:** Description of what is to be tested

**Expected result:** What test result is expected for the test to pass

**Test steps:** Step by step instructions on how to perform the test

**Test result:** PASS/FAIL

The test ID starts with the fixed prefix 'TEST'. The prefix is followed by a single letter, which defines the test type / verification method. The last part of the ID is a 3-digits *hexadecimal* number (0..9|A..F), with the first digit identifing the module, the second digit identifing a class / function, and the last digit - the test ordering number for this object. E.g. 'TEST-T-112'. Each test type has its own counter, thus 'TEST-T-112' and 'TEST-A-112' tests are different entities, but they refer to the same object (class or function) within the same module.

The verification method for a requirement is given by a single letter according to the table below:

| **Term**          | **Definition**                                                               |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inspection (I)    | Control or visual verification                                               |
| Analysis (A)      | Verification based upon analytical evidences                                 |
| Test (T)          | Verification of quantitative characteristics with quantitative measurement   |
| Demonstration (D) | Verification of operational characteristics without quantitative measurement |

## Tests preparations

Implement the test cases and the specific sub-classes on which the tests will be performed (see [ut003_serialization.py](../../tests/ut003_serialization.py))

## Test definitions (Analysis)

**Test Identifier:** TEST-A-300

**Requirement ID(s)**: REQ-FUN-300, REQ-FUN-301

**Verification method:** A

**Test goal:** Check that the recruired classes are implemented, and they deliver the serializaton and de-serialization functionality.

**Expected result:** The module defines the classes for: NULL object, C-like structure, fixed and dynamic length arrays. All these classes provide methods to serialized their stored content into a packed bytestring and JSON format string, as well as methods to create new instances of these classes from the serialized data exactly matching the content of the original serialized objects.

**Test steps:** Review the source code. Execute all test cases defined in the test module [ut003_serialization.py](../../tests/ut003_serialization.py).

**Test result:** PASS / FAIL

## Test definitions (Test)

**Test Identifier:** TEST-T-300

**Requirement ID(s)**: REQ-FUN-302

**Verification method:** T

**Test goal:** Check the presence of the required methods and their type: class or instance method.

**Expected result:** All concerned classes have class methods *getSize*, *unpackBytes*, *unpackJSON* and the instance methods *packBytes*, *packJSON*, *getNative*

**Test steps:** Perform the test on the class, not on an instance (do not instantiate). Check that the class has the required attributes using the built-in Python function *hasattr*() and the unittest method *assertTrue*(), than access the attribute using the Python built-in function *getattr*() and check its type using the unittestmethod *assertIsInstance*(): the class methods should be **types.MethodType** and the instance - **types.FunctionType**.

Implemented as method *Test_Basis.test_API* inherited by the actual test suits.

**Test result:** PASS

**Test Identifier:** TEST-T-301

**Requirement ID(s)**: REQ-AWM-305

**Verification method:** T

**Test goal:** Check the limitation on the attribute access.

**Expected result:** The following limitations on the attribute access are implemented on top of the standard Python attribute resolution scheme:

* New instance attributes can not be added in the run-time
* The values of the attributes cannot be changed, except for the declared fields of a structure
* The values of the *magic* and *private* (names starting with, at least, one underscore) attrubutes cannot be accessed; except for the attributes *\_\_name\_\_* and *\_\_cls\_\_*, which access may be allowed.

A sub-class of **AttributeError** is raised upon violation of the attribute resolution limitations.

**Test steps:** This test must be performed on an instance, not on a class.

* Try to assign any value to a non-existing attribute. Check that the expected exception is raised.
* Try to assign any value to the following attributes: *\_\_dict\_\_* (must be present on all instances of the classes being tested), *_Fields* (must be present in structures), *_ElementType* and *_Length* (must be present in arrays). Check that the expected exception is raised in all cases.
* Try to assign any value to a method attribute (*getSize*, *unpackBytes*, *unpackJSON*, *packBytes*, *packJSON*, *getNative*), which must be present in all classes. Check that the expected exception is raised in all cases.
* Try to access the value of the following attributes: *\_\_dict\_\_* (must be present on all instances of the classes being tested), *_Fields* (must be present in structures), *_ElementType* and *_Length* (must be present in arrays). Check that the expected exception is raised in all cases.
* Try to access the value of a non-exitsting attribute. Check that the expected exception is raised.

Implemented as methods *Test_Basis.test_Read_AttributeError* and *Test_Basis.test_Write_AttributeError* inherited by the actual test suits.

**Test result:** PASS

**Test Identifier:** TEST-T-302

**Requirement ID(s)**: REQ-AWM-303

**Verification method:** T

**Test goal:** Check that **TypeError** or its sub-class is raised with an improper type argument is passed into the unpacking methods.

**Expected result:** **TypeError** or its sub-class is raised if:

* *unpackJSON* method receives any type but string argument
* *unpackBytes* method receives any type but bytestring argument

**Test steps:**

* Try to call *unpackJSON* method on the class with any type of the argument except for the string. Check that **TypeError** or its sub-class exception is raised.
* Repeat with the different incompatible types of the argument.
* Try to unpack a proper JSON object using method *unpackJSON*, which doen't match the declared data structure of the class:
  * Not a dictionary for structure
  * Not a list for arrays
* Check that **TypeError** or its sub-class exception is raised.
* Repeat with the different incompatible types of the argument.
* Try to call *unpackBytes* method on the class with any type of the argument except for the bytestring. Check that **TypeError** or its sub-class exception is raised.
* Repeat with the different incompatible types of the argument.

Implemented as the methods *Test_Basis.test_unpackJSON_TypeError* and *Test_Basis.test_unpackBytes_TypeError* as well as *test_unpackJSON_TypeError* methods of the derived test suit classes **Test_SerNULL**, **Test_SerStruct**, **Test_SerArray** and **Test_SerDynamicArray**.

**Test result:** PASS

**Test Identifier:** TEST-T-303

**Requirement ID(s)**: REQ-AWM-304

**Verification method:** T

**Test goal:** Check that **ValueError** or its sub-class is raised with an improper type argument is passed into the unpacking methods.

**Expected result:** The **ValueError** or its sub-class exception is raised if:

* A string, but not a proper JSON object is passed into the method *unpackJSON*
* A proper JSON object is passed into the method *unpackJSON*, which, however, does not match the internal declared data structure of the class
* Too short or too long bytestring is passed into the method *unpackBytes*, i.e. its length doesn't match the declared data size of the class

**Test steps:**

* Try to unpack an arbitrary string using method *unpackJSON*, which is not a proper JSON object representation.
* Try to unpack a proper JSON object using method *unpackJSON*, which doen't match the declared data structure of the class:
  * Dictionary with the missing keys (declared fields) for structure
  * Dictionary with the keys not matching the declared fields for structure
  * Dictionary with, at least, ony key holding the wrong data type (as declared for the respective field) for structure
  * List containing too few elements for the fixed length array
  * List containing too many elements for the fixed length array
  * List with, at least, one element being of the type incompatible with the declared data type of the array elements - both fixed and dynamic
* Try to unpack a bytestring, which is too short or too long compared to the size of the declared data structure; for the dynamic length arrays - the length of the bytestring is not a multiple of the size of an element

Implemented as *test_unpackJSON_ValueError* and *test_unpackBytes_ValueError* methods of the test suit classes **Test_SerStruct**, **Test_SerArray** and **Test_SerDynamicArray** as well as *Test_SerNULL.test_unpackBytes_ValueError*.

**Test result:** PASS / FAIL

* Not a mapping type or an instance of structure class - for a structure
* Not a sequence type or an instance of dynamic or fixed length structure class - for a dynamic or fixed length array

**Test steps:**

* Try to instantiate a class being tested with an argument of a wrong type.
* Check that the **TypeError** or its sub-class exception is raised
* Repeat the process with several different types of the argument.
